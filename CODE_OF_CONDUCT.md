# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to creating an open and welcoming atmosphere in our project and community. We, as contributors and overseers, promise to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Behavioral Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Receiving constructive criticism with grace
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Demonstrating empathy toward other members of the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers on this [Google form][gform]. The project maintainers will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project.
